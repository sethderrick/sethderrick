Architect, Team Leader, and IC
------------------------------

I'm an engineering leader fluent in a variety of tech stacks and tooling. My career path hasn't exactly been by the book; I got my start in technology after purchasing my first computer in art school and took it from there. I like to tell people that, if you can choose where and when to buy your first computer, San Francisco in the early '90s was a remarkable place and time to do it! Since then, years in the trenches across various sectors - from finance to healthcare to adtech - have granted me invaluable personal relationships, life-changing insights, and a large collection of lessons learned the hard way.
