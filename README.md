- 👋 Hi, I’m Seth Derrick. I've been writing code and building systems since the early 1990s when I bought my first computer while attending art school in San Francisco. 
- 👀 I’m interested in building things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI/ML, data science, and ways to make my Vim workflow more productive.
- 🌱 I'm also studying the Rust language and hoping it gains wider adoption. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting problems with curious people
- 📫 You can reach me by emailing seth@sethderrick.tech
